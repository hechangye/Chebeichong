an urban flood model.
We mainly modified the infiltration module in SWMM and added a new runoff generation model, "SYSU".
Examples in 1D module and 2D module were different study areas. 1D example is one of scenario simulations in paper, which included rainfall time series and drainage networks' information.
We can use "simulations.mlx" in matlab to run the 1D module and get the boundary input to 2D module.
